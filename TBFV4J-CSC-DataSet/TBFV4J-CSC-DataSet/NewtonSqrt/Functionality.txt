The main function of this code is to calculate the square root of the input number N using Newton's method, until the
error between the calculated result and the true value is less than or equal to the given tolerance epsilon. The
program first checks if the input is valid. If N is less than 0 or epsilon is less than or equal to 0, it returns an 
error message. If the input is valid, the program uses Newton's method starting with N / 2.0 for the iteration, 
gradually approaching the square root until the difference between the square of the result and N is smaller than 
epsilon. Finally, the program outputs the calculated square root or an error message if the input is invalid.
