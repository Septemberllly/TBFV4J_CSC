The main function of this code is to calculate and output the maximum number of layers that can be constructed in a 
pyramid. The user inputs an integer N, which represents the number of bricks available. The code calculates the 
number of bricks required for each pyramid layer and determines the maximum number of layers such that the total 
number of bricks does not exceed N. Specifically, it increments the layer count result, continually calculating 
the number of bricks required for the current layer and comparing it with N, until the maximum number of layers that 
satisfies the condition is found. Finally, the program outputs the maximum number of pyramid layers result.
