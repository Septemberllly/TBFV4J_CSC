The main function of this code is to approximate the square root of a non-negative number N using the Secant Method.
The user inputs a non-negative number N and a positive small error value epsilon. The code iteratively calculates 
the square root using the Secant Method until the error in the result is less than epsilon. If the input N is 
negative or if epsilon is less than or equal to zero, the program returns an error message. During the calculation, 
two initial guesses, x0 and x1, are used, and the guesses are updated through repeated iterations until the 
desired precision is achieved. Finally, the program outputs the computed square root result, rounded to six decimal 
places.
