In this folder, we have organized and compiled 13 representative program samples used for testing the TBFV4J tool, covering a total of 57 different sets of test results. These programs encompass a variety of common functional logics and code structures, making them highly representative and aiming to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the TBFV4J tool across different scenarios.

The statistics we provide include the following aspects:

- The final test outcome for each sample (e.g., Totally verified or Counterexample);
- The execution time overhead of the tool on each program, used to assess its performance efficiency;
- The number of test cases generated by TBFV4J during the analysis process, reflecting its exploration capability and coverage;
- For programs with functional violations, we further extract and present typical counterexample outputs generated by the tool to help illustrate its accuracy and practicality in error detection.

Additionally, the test case numbers in the table correspond directly to the code file numbers in the TBFV4J-DataSet folder, allowing users to easily locate the relationship between the source programs and their corresponding results, thereby supporting further analysis and reproducibility of experiments.
