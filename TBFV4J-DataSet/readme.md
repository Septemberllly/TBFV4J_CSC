# TBFV4J: An automated testing-based formal verification tool for Java
# Introduction

## Background

The Test-Based Formal Verification (TBFV) tool presented in this paper integrates Specification-Based Testing and Formal Verification to automate the verification of whether a Java program adheres to its specifications. By employing a grey-box testing approach that leverages path exploration and constraint solving, TBFV eliminates the need for deriving loop invariants. 

Below are some TBFV-related papers also published by our research group:
