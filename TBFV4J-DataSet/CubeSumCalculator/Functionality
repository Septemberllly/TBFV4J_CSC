The function of this code is to take an integer input `x` from the user and then accumulate the cubes of integers starting from 1 until the sum is greater than or equal to `x`. 
Specifically, the program uses a `while` loop to increment a variable `n`, adding the cube of `n` to a `sum` variable at each iteration, until the value of `sum` reaches or exceeds `x`. Ultimately, the value of `n` represents the smallest integer for which the sum of cubes exceeds or equals `x` for the first time.
