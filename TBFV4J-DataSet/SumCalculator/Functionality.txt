The main function of this code is to calculate and find the smallest integer n such that the sum of integers from 1 
to n is greater than or equal to the integer x entered by the user. The user inputs an integer x, and the 
program repeatedly adds integers from 1 to n until the cumulative sum sum is greater than or equal to x, and 
finally outputs the result n.
