The main function of this code is to calculate the time and velocity required for an object to freely fall from an
initial height h0 to a specific distance y. The program first checks based on the initial height h0 and fall
distance y provided by the user. If the fall distance y is less than 0, it outputs an error message; if the fall 
distance y is greater than the initial height h0, it outputs another error message. If the input is valid, the 
program simulates the free fall process to calculate the required time t and velocity V at the specific distance,
and then outputs the time and velocity for the fall.
